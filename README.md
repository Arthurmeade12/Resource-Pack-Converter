# Resource Pack Converter for Minecraft 1.13
a tool for converting minecraft's resource pack from 1.8-1.12 to 1.13

There is a great number of changes to Minecraft 1.13 resource pack (Java Edition). That would be terrible to change all the files' name manually.
Here is a list of the changes: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.13/Flattening

This tool will automatically convert all files include **models**. I tested it for [Mizuno's 16 Craft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/mizunos-16-craft/) (my girlfriend's faverate pack) and [ZigZag](http://www.jmckiernan.com/), it works just fine.
