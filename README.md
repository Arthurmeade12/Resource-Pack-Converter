# Resource Pack Converter for Minecraft 1.13
a tool for converting minecraft's resource pack from 1.8-1.12 to 1.13

There is a great number of changes to Minecraft 1.13 resource pack (Java Edition). That would be terrible to change all the files' name manually.
Here is a list of the changes: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.13/Flattening

This tool will automatically **rename all files** & **convert all models** & **generate new format textures from the selected resource pack**(such as particles, horses, map icons...). I tested it for [Mizuno's 16 Craft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/mizunos-16-craft/) (my girlfriend's faverate pack) and [ZigZag](http://www.jmckiernan.com/), it works just fine.

It might not convert everything perfectly, however it offers a easiest way to get your pack compatible with 1.13 quickly.
- **For Creators**: it provides a starting pack from your old version.
- **For Players**: you don't have to wait the pack's author to update.

## Usage
- [Download released](https://github.com/icrdr/Resource-Pack-Converter/releases/)([mirror](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5k7w76mkbwogn5a/Resource_Pack_Converter.exe?dl=0))
- Run Resource_Pack_Converter.exe
- Select the resource pack
- Set the pack's resolution
- Wait for converting

**Please make me know if it not working properly.**
